## E-Book Ripper.

This is a python program written to autonmatically rip ebooks into a collection of png's and then compile it into a pdf by using either the inbuilt script or an online png -> pdf compiler. First install the python modules as shown in the
requirements.txt file. Then edit the X&Y coordinates in the code to line up with the pages as shown in your online ebook software. Make sure to add the coordinates of your next page button and add the correct amount of pages.

Then edit the PDF Compiler file with the relevant details as shown in the comments. This was specially made for Pearson Edexcel EBooks as I am not paying Â£60 for a book I will use for 1 year
